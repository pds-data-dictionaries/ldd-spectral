   Comment                
        This is a complete re-write of the Spectral Dictionary version 1.1.0.0  (i.e., PDS4_SP_1100, 
        released with core IM 1.4.0.0) to bring it into compliance with requirements and best practices 
        established since the original version was created.  
        
        Existing attribute definitions have been reviewed and in some cases updated.  This should be 
        reflected in the version_id value of the attribute.
        
        The "submitter_name" of "ACR" indicates Anne (C.) Raugh.

   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The net_integration_time for a spectrum is the total integration time per pixel. For many detectors (CCDs, for example), all pixels are exposed simultaneously, so this value will correspond to the observation interval. In some cases, however, an instrument will sweep across pixels, rows, or planes, so that the observation period may be substantially longer than the actual integration time contributing to the individual pixels.

   name                   Bin_Width_Constant
   description             The Bin_Width_Constant class is used inside a Bin_Width_Lookup class for those cases where the bin width is either not well known or unknown. It provides a way to specify a nominal constant width or indicate that there is no available information about the bin width. If the bin width is completely unknown, use the appropriate bin_width attribute for the spectral type (frequency, wavelength, wavenumber, or energy), and indicate that it is nil, with a reason of "unknown". When this class is used, a full explanation of the situation should be provided by the bin_width_desc attribute of the parent class.
